Here we create a styled table:

<table class="styled">
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Tables</th>
<th>Are</th>
<th>Cool</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Zebra</th>
<td>Stripes</td>
<td>Are</td>
<td>Pretty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Here</th>
<td>Is</td>
<td>Another</td>
<td>Row</td>
</tr>
</table>

Here's a code block by itself:

```
I am the first line
I am the second line
```

And here is a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function syntaxHighlighting() {
  var n = 33;
  var s = "hi";
  console.log(s);
}
```

Here's a blockquote:

> To be or not to be
> That is the *question*

I think that's it!
